so the prepareTD() shuld split the entire training dataset into a list of lists where each nested
list.len() is equal to self.miniBatch

each iteration of the for loop inside of prepareTD() shuld create new list with length self.miniBatch

it shuld then instantly append this to self.trainingImages or self.trainingLabels, the desired list of lists

so there r two things that can b inside of these nested lists, either the pillow Image object or the vector using numpy

either way i will hav to use numpy to convert the pillow Image object into a vector so i think it wuld b better to put in the nested list, then its just a question of if numpy vector is a specific object, or a list

im pretty sure its a list

so then there will b the full list with nested lists equal in size to self.miniBatch and then nested lists inside of each of these with 784 elements

it wuld look something like this (assume self.miniBatch = 2 and the entire dataset.len() = 4):

(pretend that every 784 is actaully 784 different elements)

[[[784], [784]], [[784], [784]]

then wuld need to loop through this list of lists of lists for each epoch desired
